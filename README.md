# Android Team
Strategies for running a successful Android engineering team.

This project is intended to help lead Android developers be successful at leading Android engineering teams. I have created it primarily as a repository for storing my own thoughts to facilitate myself in Android engineering leadership. Though the sourcecode found here is focused on Android development, I'd imagine many of the other thoughts - especially those in the [wiki](https://github.com/randallmitchell/android_lead/wiki) - could benefit engineering leaders regardless of platform.

The thoughts and sourcecode within this repository are [Unlicensed](https://unlicense.org). Use at your leasure and benefit, but if you share these learning online, sourcing back to this repository is appreciated.
